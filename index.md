<h1>Deploying Django Applications</h1>
<p>
I was tasked with looking at the deployment of our Django based restful API. We needed to deploy this somewhere that was publicly accessible and also free or low cost to host. Once a location for hosting was selected, I needed to identify the best way to manage the Django app on the server..

The first option I looked at was using a VPS on a Digital Oceans server. Digital Ocean make it very easy to setup a VPS that is ready to run Django apps by making use of their one click apps. With one click had Django 1.8.7 installed and ready to go on an Ubuntu 16.04 server. This Option seemed to be a good way of running things aside from the fact that it would cost me $5USD a month, which I was not too worried about paying. I decided this option was not the best though when I started thing about setting up the Django App for the client in the future. Because of this I decided to look into deploying Django apps in a Docker container. I looked at the options that were available for Django deployment on Docker Hub. There is a Docker for Django but it is unfortunately no longer being supported. It is now recommended that people use the standard python Docker and install the library they need onto it. My hosting options for Docker are the same as the first option, there is a one click app that is available on Digital Ocean that would set us up with an Ubuntu server running Docker. Once again there would be a monthly cost of $5USD. I really liked this option because Docker containers are easy to move from one server to another. Using this we would be able to develop an app, test it on the server, then port it directly to another server without having to worry about set up or support on the production server. This is because Docker containers run in a virtualised environment, therefore the hardware and operating system are not of concern.

I decided that I should also look at some free options for hosting. The students from last semester used pythonanywhere to host their solutions so I looked into it. I find that deploying to python anywhere was very easy. I wrote documentation on this process as it will be where we test all of our Django Apps. I decided to use python anywhere because it is free for us to use for development. Unfortunately is will not be as easy to deploy for end users. However I am glad that I looked at Docker because I think it will be the easiest way for us give the app to the end users. So for now we will develop on python anywhere but when it is time to put it into production I think it will be best to port the app into a Docker container and put that on the production server.

You can find my documentation for the deployment of Django apps can be found in the docs file in the project repo<sup>i</sup>. I also looked at these Docker <sup>ii</sup> <sup>iii</sup>.
